# Principal Ideal Domains (PIDs)

## Definition

> [!info] Definition (Principal Ideal)
> An ideal $I$ of a ring $R$ is **principal** if it is generated by a single element:
> $$I = (a) = aR = \{ar : r \in R\}$$

> [!info] Definition (PID)
> A **principal ideal domain (PID)** is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal.

## Intuition

PIDs are integral domains where every ideal has a particularly simple structure - generated by just one element. This makes factorization theory and the study of modules much more tractable.

## Key Properties

1. Every Euclidean domain is a PID
2. Every PID is a UFD (unique factorization domain)
3. In a PID, every nonzero prime ideal is maximal
4. PIDs are Noetherian (every ascending chain of ideals stabilizes)
5. If $R$ is a PID, then $R[x]$ is a UFD but generally not a PID

## Examples

> [!example] Example 1: $\mathbb{Z}$
> The integers form a PID:
> - Every ideal has form $n\mathbb{Z} = (n)$ for some $n \geq 0$

> [!example] Example 2: $F[x]$ for Field $F$
> Polynomial rings over fields are PIDs:
> - Every ideal is generated by a single polynomial (of minimal degree in the ideal)

> [!example] Example 3: $\mathbb{Z}[i]$
> The Gaussian integers form a PID (they are actually a Euclidean domain).

## Non-Examples

> [!warning] Non-Example: $\mathbb{Z}[x]$
> The ring $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is **not** a PID:
> - The ideal $(2, x)$ is not principal
> - It's a UFD but not a PID

> [!warning] Non-Example: $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$
> The ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ is **not** a PID:
> - $6 = 2 \cdot 3 = (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5})$
> - Two distinct factorizations, so not even a UFD

## Theorems

> [!abstract] Structure Theorem for Finitely Generated Modules over PIDs
> Every finitely generated module $M$ over a PID $R$ decomposes as:
> $$M \cong R^r \oplus R/(a_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus R/(a_k)$$
> where $a_1 | a_2 | \cdots | a_k$ (invariant factors).

> [!abstract] PID implies UFD
> Every PID is a UFD. The converse is false ($\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is a counterexample).
