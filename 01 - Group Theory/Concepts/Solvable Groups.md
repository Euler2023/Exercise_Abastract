# Solvable Groups

## Definition

> [!info] Definition (Derived Series)
> A group $G$ is **solvable** if its derived series terminates at the trivial group:
> $$G = G^{(0)} \trianglerighteq G^{(1)} \trianglerighteq G^{(2)} \trianglerighteq \cdots \trianglerighteq G^{(n)} = \{e\}$$
> where $G^{(i+1)} = [G^{(i)}, G^{(i)}]$ is the commutator subgroup.

> [!info] Equivalent Definition (Normal Series)
> $G$ is solvable iff there exists a chain:
> $$\{e\} = G_0 \triangleleft G_1 \triangleleft \cdots \triangleleft G_n = G$$
> where each quotient $G_{i+1}/G_i$ is **abelian**.

The name "solvable" comes from Galois theory: a polynomial is solvable by radicals iff its Galois group is solvable.

## Key Properties

> [!abstract] Theorem (Characterizations)
> For a finite group $G$, the following are equivalent:
> 1. $G$ is solvable
> 2. $G$ has a composition series with all factors cyclic of prime order
> 3. $G$ has a subnormal series with abelian factors
> 4. The derived series of $G$ reaches $\{e\}$

### Closure Properties

> [!abstract] Theorem
> 1. **Subgroups**: If $G$ is solvable and $H \leq G$, then $H$ is solvable
> 2. **Quotients**: If $G$ is solvable and $N \trianglelefteq G$, then $G/N$ is solvable
> 3. **Extensions**: If $N \trianglelefteq G$ with $N$ and $G/N$ solvable, then $G$ is solvable

> [!tip] Derived Length
> The **derived length** of a solvable group is the smallest $n$ such that $G^{(n)} = \{e\}$.
> - Derived length 0: trivial group
> - Derived length 1: abelian groups
> - Derived length 2: metabelian groups

## The Derived Series

> [!info] Definition (Commutator Subgroup)
> The **commutator subgroup** (or derived subgroup) of $G$ is:
> $$G' = [G, G] = \langle [g, h] : g, h \in G \rangle$$
> where $[g, h] = g^{-1}h^{-1}gh$.

**Properties**:
- $G' \trianglelefteq G$ (characteristic subgroup)
- $G/G'$ is the largest abelian quotient of $G$
- $G$ is abelian iff $G' = \{e\}$

### Computing the Derived Series

> [!example] Derived Series of $S_4$
> $$S_4 \trianglerighteq A_4 \trianglerighteq V_4 \trianglerighteq \{e\}$$
>
> - $S_4' = A_4$ (even permutations)
> - $A_4' = V_4$ (Klein four-group)
> - $V_4' = \{e\}$ (abelian)
>
> Derived length = 3, so $S_4$ is solvable.

## Examples of Solvable Groups

### Abelian Groups

> [!example] All Abelian Groups are Solvable
> If $G$ is abelian, then $G' = \{e\}$, so the derived series is:
> $$G \trianglerighteq \{e\}$$
> Derived length = 1.

### Symmetric Groups (Small $n$)

> [!example] $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$ are Solvable
> | Group | Order | Derived Series | Length |
> |-------|-------|----------------|--------|
> | $S_1$ | 1 | $\{e\}$ | 0 |
> | $S_2$ | 2 | $S_2 \trianglerighteq \{e\}$ | 1 |
> | $S_3$ | 6 | $S_3 \trianglerighteq A_3 \trianglerighteq \{e\}$ | 2 |
> | $S_4$ | 24 | $S_4 \trianglerighteq A_4 \trianglerighteq V_4 \trianglerighteq \{e\}$ | 3 |

### $p$-Groups

> [!success] Theorem
> Every finite $p$-group is solvable.
>
> **Proof**: By induction on $|G|$. The center $Z(G)$ is non-trivial for $p$-groups, so $G/Z(G)$ is a smaller $p$-group (solvable by induction), and $Z(G)$ is abelian (solvable). By extension property, $G$ is solvable.

### Groups of Small Order

> [!example] Solvable Groups by Order
> All groups of order $< 60$ are solvable.
>
> The smallest non-solvable group is $A_5$ with order 60.

### Nilpotent Groups

> [!abstract] Theorem
> Every nilpotent group is solvable.
>
> In particular, every finite $p$-group is nilpotent, hence solvable.

## Non-Solvable Groups

> [!warning] $A_5$ is Not Solvable
> The alternating group $A_5$ is simple and non-abelian.
>
> **Proof**: $A_5' = A_5$ (since $A_5$ is perfect: generated by commutators).
> The derived series is constant: $A_5 = A_5 = A_5 = \cdots$
> Never reaches $\{e\}$!

> [!warning] $S_n$ for $n \geq 5$ is Not Solvable
> Since $A_n \trianglelefteq S_n$ and $A_n$ is simple non-abelian for $n \geq 5$:
> - The derived series of $S_n$ reaches $A_n$ but goes no further
> - $A_n' = A_n$ for $n \geq 5$

### Simple Non-Abelian Groups

> [!abstract] Theorem
> A simple group is solvable if and only if it is cyclic of prime order.
>
> **Corollary**: Every non-abelian simple group is non-solvable.

## Connection to Galois Theory

> [!success] Galois' Theorem
> A polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ is **solvable by radicals** if and only if its Galois group $\text{Gal}(f)$ is solvable.

### Why Quintics are Unsolvable

> [!example] The General Quintic
> The general polynomial of degree 5 has Galois group $S_5$.
>
> Since $S_5$ is not solvable (contains $A_5$ which is simple non-abelian), the general quintic cannot be solved by radicals.
>
> This is the **Abel-Ruffini Theorem** (1824).

### The Key Insight

The connection works because:
1. Adjoining an $n$-th root corresponds to a cyclic extension of degree dividing $n$
2. A tower of radical extensions gives a tower of cyclic (hence abelian) extensions
3. Solvable groups are exactly those with abelian composition factors

## Important Theorems

### Burnside's Theorem

> [!success] Theorem (Burnside, 1904)
> Every group of order $p^a q^b$ (for primes $p, q$) is solvable.

This was originally proved using character theory. A purely group-theoretic proof wasn't found until 1972 (Goldschmidt, Bender, Matsuyama).

### Feit-Thompson Theorem

> [!success] Theorem (Feit-Thompson, 1963)
> Every group of **odd order** is solvable.
>
> Equivalently: Every non-abelian simple group has even order.

This is a landmark result—the proof is 255 pages! It implies every non-solvable group contains an element of order 2.

### Hall's Theorem

> [!abstract] Theorem (Philip Hall)
> A finite group $G$ is solvable if and only if for every set of primes $\pi$, $G$ has a Hall $\pi$-subgroup (subgroup of order equal to the $\pi$-part of $|G|$).

## Derived Length and Structure

### Metabelian Groups

> [!info] Definition
> A group $G$ is **metabelian** if $G'' = \{e\}$, i.e., derived length $\leq 2$.
>
> Equivalently: $G$ has a normal subgroup $N$ with both $N$ and $G/N$ abelian.

Examples:
- $S_3$ (derived length 2)
- Dihedral groups $D_n$
- Upper triangular matrices over a field

### Supersolvable Groups

> [!info] Definition
> A group $G$ is **supersolvable** if it has a normal series with cyclic factors:
> $$\{e\} = G_0 \triangleleft G_1 \triangleleft \cdots \triangleleft G_n = G$$
> with each $G_i \trianglelefteq G$ (not just $G_{i-1}$) and $G_i/G_{i-1}$ cyclic.

Every supersolvable group is solvable, but not conversely (e.g., $A_4$).

## Solvable Radical

> [!info] Definition
> The **solvable radical** $\text{Rad}(G)$ of a group $G$ is the largest solvable normal subgroup of $G$.

- Always exists (generated by all solvable normal subgroups)
- $G/\text{Rad}(G)$ has trivial solvable radical (semisimple in some sense)

## Computational Aspects

### Testing Solvability

**Algorithm**: To test if a finite group $G$ is solvable:
1. Compute $G' = [G, G]$
2. If $G' = G$, check if $G = \{e\}$
3. If $G' \neq G$, recursively test $G'$
4. The group is solvable iff the derived series reaches $\{e\}$

### Composition Series

For solvable groups, the composition factors are all cyclic of prime order:
$$\{e\} \triangleleft C_{p_1} \triangleleft \cdots \triangleleft G$$
