# Exercise MF4: Dimension of Spaces of Modular Forms

## Problem Statement

> [!question] Problem
> Let $M_k = M_k(\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}))$ denote the space of modular forms of weight $k$, and $S_k$ the subspace of cusp forms.
>
> **(a)** Using the dimension formula, compute $\dim M_k$ and $\dim S_k$ for $k = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16$.
>
> **(b)** Show that $M_8 = \mathbb{C} \cdot E_4^2$ and $M_{10} = \mathbb{C} \cdot E_4 E_6$.
>
> **(c)** Find a basis for $M_{12}$ and for $S_{12}$.
>
> **(d)** Prove that $M_* = \mathbb{C}[E_4, E_6]$ is freely generated by $E_4$ and $E_6$ (i.e., there are no polynomial relations between them).

## Hints

> [!hint]- Hint 1
> The dimension formula is: $\dim M_k = \lfloor k/12 \rfloor + 1$ for $k \equiv 0, 4, 6, 8, 10 \pmod{12}$, and $\dim M_k = \lfloor k/12 \rfloor$ for $k \equiv 2 \pmod{12}$. Also $M_k = 0$ for $k < 0$ or $k$ odd.

> [!hint]- Hint 2
> For part (b), if $\dim M_k = 1$ and you have a non-zero element, it spans the space.

> [!hint]- Hint 3
> For part (d), compare dimensions. If $M_k = \mathbb{C}[E_4, E_6]_k$, count monomials $E_4^a E_6^b$ with $4a + 6b = k$.

## Solution

> [!success]- Solution
> **(a)** Dimension table:
>
> | $k$ | $\dim M_k$ | $\dim S_k$ |
> |-----|------------|------------|
> | 4 | 1 | 0 |
> | 6 | 1 | 0 |
> | 8 | 1 | 0 |
> | 10 | 1 | 0 |
> | 12 | 2 | 1 |
> | 14 | 1 | 0 |
> | 16 | 2 | 1 |
>
> Note: $\dim S_k = \dim M_k - 1$ when $k \geq 12$ (subtracting the Eisenstein series), and $S_k = 0$ for $k < 12$.
>
> **(b)**
> - $E_4^2$ has weight $8$ and is non-zero. Since $\dim M_8 = 1$, we have $M_8 = \mathbb{C} \cdot E_4^2$.
> - $E_4 E_6$ has weight $10$ and is non-zero. Since $\dim M_{10} = 1$, we have $M_{10} = \mathbb{C} \cdot E_4 E_6$.
>
> **(c)** For $M_{12}$:
> - $\dim M_{12} = 2$
> - Candidates: $E_4^3$ (weight 12), $E_6^2$ (weight 12), and $\Delta$ (weight 12, cusp form)
> - Basis for $M_{12}$: $\{E_4^3, E_6^2\}$ or equivalently $\{E_4^3, \Delta\}$ (since $\Delta = \frac{E_4^3 - E_6^2}{1728}$)
> - Basis for $S_{12}$: $\{\Delta\}$ (one-dimensional)
>
> **(d)** To show $M_* = \mathbb{C}[E_4, E_6]$ is free:
>
> The number of monomials $E_4^a E_6^b$ with $4a + 6b = k$ equals the number of non-negative integer solutions.
>
> For $k = 4$: $(a,b) = (1,0)$. Count: 1 = $\dim M_4$ ✓
> For $k = 6$: $(a,b) = (0,1)$. Count: 1 = $\dim M_6$ ✓
> For $k = 8$: $(a,b) = (2,0)$. Count: 1 = $\dim M_8$ ✓
> For $k = 10$: $(a,b) = (1,1)$. Count: 1 = $\dim M_{10}$ ✓
> For $k = 12$: $(a,b) \in \{(3,0), (0,2)\}$. Count: 2 = $\dim M_{12}$ ✓
>
> The dimension of the polynomial ring matches $\dim M_k$ for all $k$, so there are no relations.
