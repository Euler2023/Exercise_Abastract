# Diophantine Equations

## Definition

> [!info] Definition
> A **Diophantine equation** is a polynomial equation $f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = 0$ where we seek solutions in integers or rationals.

Named after Diophantus of Alexandria (~250 AD).

## Fundamental Questions

1. **Existence**: Does a solution exist?
2. **Finiteness**: Are there finitely or infinitely many solutions?
3. **Finding**: Can we find all solutions explicitly?
4. **Parametrization**: Can we describe the solution set?

## Classification by Degree and Variables

### Linear Equations

$$a_1 x_1 + \cdots + a_n x_n = c$$

> [!abstract] Theorem (Linear Diophantine)
> $ax + by = c$ has integer solutions iff $\gcd(a, b) | c$.
> General solution: $(x_0 + \frac{b}{d}t, y_0 - \frac{a}{d}t)$ for $t \in \mathbb{Z}$.

### Quadratic Equations

**Pell's Equation**: $x^2 - Dy^2 = 1$

> [!abstract] Theorem
> For non-square $D > 0$:
> - Infinitely many solutions
> - All solutions generated by fundamental solution via $(x_1 + y_1\sqrt{D})^n$

**Sum of Two Squares**: $n = x^2 + y^2$

> [!abstract] Theorem (Fermat)
> $n$ is a sum of two squares iff all prime factors $p \equiv 3 \pmod 4$ appear to even powers.

### Higher Degree

| Equation | Solutions | Method |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| $x^3 + y^3 = z^3$ | $(0,0,0)$ only (nontrivial) | Descent (Euler) |
| $x^4 + y^4 = z^2$ | $(0,0,0)$ only | Descent (Fermat) |
| $x^n + y^n = z^n$, $n \geq 3$ | $(0,0,0)$ only | FLT (Wiles) |
| $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ | Finitely generated | Mordell-Weil |

## The Geometric Viewpoint

> [!tip] Modern Approach
> A Diophantine equation $f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = 0$ defines an algebraic variety $X$. We study $X(\mathbb{Z})$ or $X(\mathbb{Q})$.

### Curves

| Genus | $C(\mathbb{Q})$ | Example |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| 0 | $\emptyset$, finite, or $\infty$ | Conics |
| 1 | Finitely generated group | Elliptic curves |
| $\geq 2$ | Finite (Faltings) | $x^n + y^n = 1$, $n \geq 4$ |

## Famous Diophantine Problems

### Fermat's Last Theorem

> [!abstract] Theorem (Wiles, 1995)
> For $n \geq 3$: $x^n + y^n = z^n$ has no solutions with $xyz \neq 0$.

**Proof idea**: Suppose $(a, b, c)$ is a solution. The Frey curve $E: y^2 = x(x-a^n)(x+b^n)$ would be:
1. Semistable (Ribet)
2. Not modular (if it existed)

But all semistable elliptic curves ARE modular (Wiles). Contradiction!

### Catalan's Conjecture (Mihăilescu's Theorem)

> [!abstract] Theorem (Mihăilescu, 2002)
> The only solution to $x^p - y^q = 1$ with $x, y > 0$ and $p, q > 1$ is $3^2 - 2^3 = 1$.

### The Congruent Number Problem

> [!question]
> Which integers $n$ are the area of a right triangle with rational sides?

$n$ is **congruent** iff $y^2 = x^3 - n^2 x$ has a point of infinite order.

By BSD, this relates to $L(E_n, 1) = 0$ or $\neq 0$.

## Methods

### Descent

Reduce solving $f = 0$ to solving simpler equations.

> [!example] Fermat's Descent
> To show $x^4 + y^4 = z^2$ has no nontrivial solutions:
> Assume minimal solution exists → construct smaller solution → contradiction.

### Local-Global

Check solvability over $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for all $p$.

> [!warning] Failures
> The Hasse principle can fail! Example: $3x^3 + 4y^3 + 5z^3 = 0$ is locally solvable but has no rational points.

### Modular Methods

Connect to modular forms via Galois representations.

> [!abstract] Modularity Lifting
> If $\bar{\rho}_{E,p}$ is modular and satisfies certain conditions, then $E$ is modular.

### Heights and Diophantine Approximation

> [!abstract] Roth's Theorem
> For algebraic $\alpha$ and $\epsilon > 0$:
> $$\left|\alpha - \frac{p}{q}\right| > \frac{1}{q^{2+\epsilon}}$$
> for all but finitely many $p/q$.

## Hilbert's 10th Problem

> [!question] Hilbert (1900)
> Is there an algorithm to decide if a Diophantine equation has integer solutions?

> [!abstract] Theorem (Davis-Putnam-Robinson-Matiyasevich, 1970)
> **No!** The problem is undecidable.

Over $\mathbb{Q}$: Still open!
